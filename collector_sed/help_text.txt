This app roughly simulates the action of the collector vehicle traversing the seafloor and redistributing sediment laterally along the seafloor. The view is a cross section of the seafloor with the collector vehicle moving into and out of the screen. Each "cell" is one collector track.

Change the settings and set the start and stop cells, then click `Run`. The seafloor can also be clicked to pass the collector through that cell.

Settings:

* Cut Depth - the depth that the collector vehicle cuts into the seafloor.

* Extra cut depth -  An "extra" amount of cut can be set to take up more of the deposited sediment.

* Left to right ratio - How much of the sediment goes left, and how much goes right. 1: all the sediment goes left, 0: all the sediment goes right.

* Percent to settle - Proportion of the sediment that settles on each cell.

* Settled density - the dry bulk density of the settled sediment.

* Base density - the dry bulk density of the original seafloor.

* Number of cells - effectively the width of the simulation.

* Start and Stop cells - the simulation can be set to automatically run from cell Start to cell Stop, left to right.

* Color by horizon - Each cell is colored by horizon, so all cells from the same settling event or collector pass have the same color.

* Color by distance travelled - Each cell is covered by the distance that sediment travelled from the collector track where it originated.

* Run - Run the simulation with the given Settings.

* Reset clicked cells - Reset any cells that have been clicked.
